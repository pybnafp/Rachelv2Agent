</div>

Multi-step retrosynthesis is not only about proposing a locally plausible disconnection. It also requires preserving scaffold consistency, functional-group compatibility, route convergence, and precursor executability across multiple dependent steps. Rachel is built around that stricter formulation.

Rachel follows three core principles: it supplies chemical information rather
than replacing chemical judgment; chemical truth and route quality always come
first; and route design should be bold and inventive while every committed step
is validated and audited strictly. Templates, Smart CAP, reaction-family names,
scores, and gates are structured aids. The LLM or chemist remains responsible
for designing the chemistry and deciding what the evidence supports.

Rather than treating retrosynthesis as a one-shot text generation problem, Rachel formalizes route construction as a persistent `state -> action -> validation -> commit` process. Action steps are explored in a sandbox, checked by chemistry-grounded validators, and only then written into the main route tree. The result is a planning workflow that is easier to inspect, recover, compare, and analyze at route level.

At a glance, Rachel combines:

- persistent session state instead of isolated route guesses
- chemistry-grounded reference operators such as bond disconnection and FGI
- sandboxed local trials before route-tree commitment
- validation gates including forward checks, atom balance, and site-aware auditing
- explicit route memory, audit traces, and exportable planning artifacts
- LLM-directed route and reaction design over structured chemical evidence

## Trace Demo

The trace above is the fastest visual entry point into Rachel. It shows how the system moves from structured context to sandboxed actions, validation evidence, LLM/chemist selection, and committed route growth.

<img width="1560" height="1120" alt="trace_final" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eca73f1-25c9-4816-b7da-6bbfc24853e3" />

- The emphasis is on planning behavior, not only final route output
- Rejected attempts remain part of the story instead of disappearing into free-form text
- The figure is useful for understanding what Rachel is doing between target input and final route export

## End-to-End Example

The figure below compares a PaRoutes ground-truth plan with Rachel's generated result on case `n1_366`.

<img width="2500" height="4459" alt="n1_366_groundtruth_vs_rachel_annotated_case_en" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38952d7e-8dc4-4f92-b13c-eee61175b0ec" />

This is included as a route-level qualitative reference, not merely a single-step plausibility check. The relevant question is whether the route remains interpretable and structurally coherent as a whole.

<a id="why-rachel"></a>
## Why Rachel

Many retrosynthesis systems can output route-like text. Rachel is organized around a different question: how should a route be **constructed** when intermediate decisions must remain visible, reviewable, and recoverable?

That framing creates a strict role boundary:

- the LLM or chemist owns route hypotheses, reaction design, precursor
  completion, evidence reconciliation, and terminal decisions
- the chemistry layer supplies molecular facts, candidate-space scaffolds,
  atom/source/topology observations, and validation findings
- the orchestration layer preserves state, route-tree structure, and decision history
- validation gates classify contradiction, proof obligation, warning, and tool
  limitation; they do not choose the reaction

Rachel therefore shifts the task from "generate a route" to "make bold chemical
hypotheses inside a traceable process that forces strict validation before the
route changes."

## Highlights

| Capability | What it means in Rachel |
| --- | --- |
| Stateful planning | Rachel reasons over persistent session state instead of isolated one-shot answers. |
| Reference action space | Bond disconnection, FGI, templates, and Smart CAP suggest possible chemistry without defining the retrosynthesis boundary. |
| Sandbox before commitment | Action steps are tried locally before they affect the main route tree. |
| Evidence-classifying gates | Forward checks, atom balance, topology, and site audits separate contradictions, proof obligations, warnings, and tool limits. |
| Site-aware auditing | Local position consistency checks help catch deceptively plausible but misaligned precursors. |
| Topology and atom-source proof | High-risk ring/scaffold edits carry atom-mapped evidence, family interpretation, and override-aware audit prompts. |
| Structured route memory | Accepted steps become explicit route-tree objects rather than only free-form text. |
| Audit-aware planning | Failed attempts and local checks remain available as planning evidence instead of being discarded. |
| LLM as chemistry decision layer | The LLM can propose unlisted chemistry and owns the final route judgment, while every commit remains auditable. |

## Current Planning Contract

- Listed Rachel actions and complete LLM-designed one-step actions are peer
  hypotheses. A custom action leads with its positive chemical case; comparison
  and rejected IDs are secondary provenance used only when relevant.
- A complex target can begin with a short provisional route thesis and then use
  Rachel site/action evidence to support, falsify, enrich, or revise it. When
  molecule-level facts are insufficient, site evidence can come first.
- Discovery emphasizes route design, convergence, scaffold/handle strategy,
  and candidate generation. Audit exposes state-specific validation guidance
  only when the corresponding evidence exists.
- Experience cards are relevance-filtered reminders, not chemical verdicts or
  a quota to fill. Sparse contexts can remain sparse.
- `review_terminal` reopens the same terminal leaf in the original route tree.
  The added route follows the normal planning loop and must later be closed by
  an explicit `finalize`.

<a id="system-view"></a>
## System View

Rachel follows a layered design: orchestration manages the planning session,
chemistry tools generate facts, hints, and validation evidence, and the LLM or
chemist designs and selects chemistry over compressed structured context.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    U["Researcher or LLM chemistry judgment"] --> O["Orchestration layer<br/>session state, queue, route tree, commit history"]
    O --> C["Chemistry tools<br/>bond disconnection, FGI, template scan, molecule analysis"]
    C --> S["Sandbox actions"]
    S --> V["Evidence classification<br/>contradictions, proof obligations, warnings, tool limits"]
    V --> D{"LLM or chemist decision"}
    D -->|commit supported event| T["Committed route tree"]
    D -->|revise, replace, or reject| A["Audit trail and rejected attempts"]
    T --> O
    A --> O
```

This separation matters. Deterministic tools establish inspectable facts; the
model is free to challenge weak templates and invent better chemistry, but it
cannot write an unaudited event into the route tree.

## Orchestration View

The repository is not only a collection of reaction operators. It also exposes an explicit planning protocol that makes state transitions inspectable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    I["init"] --> N["next"]
    N --> X["context(compact)<br/>molecule-level cognition"]
    X -->|complex target, useful molecule facts| RP["route_plan<br/>provisional revision-0 thesis"]
    X -->|simple target or evidence-first path| S1["reaction_sites<br/>site-first evidence"]
    RP --> S1
    S1 --> S2["explore_site<br/>same-site actions"]
    S2 -->|listed peer action| T["try_action<br/>sandbox validation"]
    S2 -->|complete LLM peer action| P["propose_action"]
    S2 -->|route-thesis change or multi-event idea| RS["route_sketch<br/>strategy-to-action sketch"]
    RS --> P
    P --> T
    T --> L["sandbox_list<br/>compact comparison"]
    L -->|selected| C["commit"]
    L -->|terminal| A["accept"]
    C --> Q["queue and route tree update"]
    A --> Q
    Q --> N
    Q -->|pending strategy continuation| RC["next prioritizes continuation precursor"]
    RC --> N
    Q --> F["finalize, report, export"]
    F -->|chemist requests deeper decomposition| R["review_terminal<br/>reopen same tree leaf"]
    R --> N
```

This is the main reason Rachel reads more like a planning system than a one-shot
generator. A provisional `route_plan` can be challenged and completed with
site evidence; listed and LLM-designed actions share the same sandbox path;
`route_sketch` is reserved for route-level translation, multi-event ideas, and
terminal review rather than acting as permission for custom chemistry. When a
mini-route needs multiple real events, persistent continuation keeps the next
precursor visible. Reopened terminals return to this same loop instead of a
separate repair path.

## Validation Stack

The paper-intro framing becomes more concrete if the validators are made explicit:

| Validation layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Forward executability | Checks whether a proposed step remains plausible under forward-style evaluation. |
| Atom and scaffold consistency | Prevents bookkeeping errors and route drift that look plausible in text but fail structurally. |
| Functional-group compatibility | Flags local chemistry conflicts before commitment. |
| Site-aware auditing | Helps detect same-scaffold precursors that modify the wrong position. |
| Route-state constraints | Ensures accepted steps remain consistent with the live session and route-tree state. |

Validation results are exposed as commit-facing gates rather than only a single
score:

- `blocked`: do not commit; distinguish a chemistry contradiction from a validator/system error
- `proof_required`: add atom-source, site, tether, anchor, or mechanism evidence before any override
- `inconclusive`: separate chemistry evidence gaps from template/tool coverage limits
- `warning`: address the warning explicitly before commit
- `clear`: no gate objection; normal chemistry review still applies

Public `RetroCmd` validation payloads use `rachel.validation.v2`. Legacy
`forward_validation`, `validation_micro`, and `evidence_packet` structures remain
readable in historical session files but are not the normal LLM-facing protocol.

Reaction family names and forward-template coverage are proof-obligation hints,
not hard gates by themselves. A family mismatch, unknown custom reaction name, or
`template_not_attempted` should require stronger atom-source/site-fidelity
evidence; only concrete chemical contradictions such as atom/skeleton imbalance,
forbidden functionality, or a true topology hard fail should block directly.
Reactive organometallic reagents remain in the current reaction precursor set;
preflight records their organic-halide and metal sources as a separate upstream
obligation before verdicts are made.

## Core Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Compact context"] --> B["Real reaction site"]
    B --> C["Same-site actions"]
    C --> D["Sandbox validation"]
    D --> E["Commit, accept, or propose custom"]
    E --> F["Updated route tree"]
```

This is the compact view of the Rachel loop. The key difference from route-text generation is that validated actions become durable route objects, while rejected actions remain informative planning artifacts.

## Selected Molecules

Rachel is currently showcased with three qualitative examples chosen to cover complementary strengths.

| Molecule | Role | Route depth | What it highlights |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `QNTR` | Experimentally grounded example | 6 steps | A route tied to real synthesis experience, useful for comparing planning behavior against laboratory practice |
| `Losartan` | Canonical medicinal chemistry target | 4 steps | Convergent route logic with recognizable medicinal chemistry disconnections |
| `Rivaroxaban` | Deeper drug-like example | 5 steps | Longer-horizon planning with a broader transformation mix |

### QNTR

QNTR is the most experimentally grounded case in the current README. It is connected to a completed synthesis campaign rather than being only a benchmark-style target, which makes it a useful reference for judging whether Rachel is recovering route strategy rather than merely satisfying local templates.

In this case, the real synthesis and Rachel's current route converge on a similar three-part decomposition with overlapping terminal building blocks, related intermediates, and closely aligned reaction logic. Earlier Rachel versions were notably weaker on FGI handling and on ring opening or closure behavior. That gap was one of the main reasons for pushing the system toward a more chemistry-feasible planning framework.

#### Experimental Route

#### Early Rachel Route

<img width="2260" height="2150" alt="synthesis_tree - 副本" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b03cfe51-d94e-4271-8000-ed0b1712810c" />

#### Current Rachel Route

<img width="2580" height="2150" alt="synthesis_tree" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1761ab3e-baa9-411e-a787-51b454e021b6" />

- 6-step route from 4 starting materials
- Useful as a route-level comparison between experimental chemistry and model-guided planning
- Valuable because the accepted route reflects decomposition strategy, not only local template satisfaction
- Also useful historically, because it shows what Rachel used to get wrong and what the current workflow is designed to correct

### Losartan

A canonical medicinal chemistry target with a recognizable convergent route.

- 4-step route from 4 starting materials
- Highlights tetrazole formation, N-alkylation, and Suzuki coupling logic
- Useful as a benchmark-like example that many readers can immediately interpret

### Rivaroxaban

A deeper drug-like example with a richer transformation mix.

- 5-step route from 4 starting materials
- Highlights Buchwald-Hartwig amination, FGI, cyclization, and amide formation
- Useful for showing that Rachel is not limited to short or purely toy routes

### Dual Drug-Case Comparison

The figure below places the Losartan and Rivaroxaban examples into one annotated comparison view.

<img width="3000" height="3755" alt="rivaroxaban_losartan_dual_annotated_en" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb6c479-3f63-41fc-921f-62a565909dd1" />

- `Losartan` emphasizes classical convergent medicinal chemistry logic
- `Rivaroxaban` emphasizes deeper route depth and operator diversity
- The pair helps readers compare route style, not just isolated outcomes

## Minimal Quickstart

Current local runs assume a Python environment with the main research dependencies already available, including Python 3.10+, RDKit, `numpy`, and `Pillow`.

```python
from Rachel.main import RetroCmd

cmd = RetroCmd("my_session.json")

cmd.execute(
    "init",
    {
        "target": "CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1",
        "name": "Paracetamol",
        "terminal_cs_threshold": 1.5,
    },
)

ctx = cmd.execute("next", {})
sites = cmd.execute("reaction_sites", {})

site_id = sites["site_reaction_map"][0]["site_id"]
detail = cmd.execute("explore_site", {"site_id": site_id})

# Listed and complete LLM-designed actions are peer hypotheses. This flag only
# demonstrates both API branches; normal use chooses on chemistry and route fit.
use_llm_peer = False
if use_llm_peer:
    peer = cmd.execute(
        "propose_action",
        {
            "precursors": ["CC(=O)Cl", "Nc1ccc(O)cc1"],
            "reagents": ["CCN(CC)CC"],
            "reaction_name": "Schotten-Baumann acylation",
            "action_label": "peer acetylation precursor set",
            "why_existing_actions_rejected": "",
            "rationale_summary": "Acetyl chloride supplies the acetyl carbonyl, p-aminophenol supplies the amide nitrogen and aryl-phenol skeleton, and base captures HCl; this is one chemoselective amide-forming event at the aniline nitrogen.",
            "risk_tags": ["custom_precursor", "atom_accounting", "chemoselectivity"],
        },
    )
    action_id = peer["action_id"]
else:
    action_id = detail["actions"][0]["action_id"]

attempt = cmd.execute("try_action", {"action_id": action_id})
sandbox = cmd.execute("sandbox_list", {})
validation = attempt["validation"]

committed = cmd.execute(
    "commit",
    {
        "idx": attempt["attempt_idx"],
        "expected_action_id": action_id,
        "reasoning": "Explicit site, precursor, atom-accounting, validation, and rejected-action audit.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "rejected": [],
    },
)
assert committed.get("step_id")
```

When a chemist asks to continue decomposing a terminal from a closed or
historical route, reopen the original tree leaf rather than starting a detached
analysis:

```python
cmd.execute("review_terminal", {
    "smiles": terminal_smiles,
    "reason": "chemist requests deeper decomposition",
    "additional_steps": 10,
})
```

The node returns to the normal `next`/site/action/validation/commit loop. After
the extended tree closes, call `finalize` again explicitly.

This is a protocol-level example, not a full benchmark workflow. Use
[SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the executable LLM contract, [workflow.md](workflow.md)
for design rationale, and [refs.md](refs.md) for exact command fields and return
structures.

## Typical Outputs

A completed run can export route-level artifacts rather than only a final answer string.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S["Planning session"] --> E["export"]
    E --> A["session.json"]
    E --> B["tree.json and tree.txt"]
    E --> C["SYNTHESIS_REPORT.html and .md"]
    E --> D["terminals.json"]
    E --> F["visualization.json"]
    E --> G["images/"]
```

Typical outputs include:

- `SYNTHESIS_REPORT.html` and `SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md`
- `report.txt` for a forward-style textual summary
- `tree.json` and `tree.txt` for route-tree inspection
- `terminals.json` for starting-material lists
